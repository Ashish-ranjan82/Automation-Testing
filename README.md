- **Logging and Reporting**: Generate detailed logs and reports for each test execution for easy tracking and debugging.

### Technologies Used:
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Automate web browser interactions.
- **Java**: Core programming language for the automation scripts.
- **JUnit/TestNG**: Framework for organizing and running tests.
- **Maven**: Manage dependencies and project structure.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the required dependencies using Maven.
3. Configure the WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).
4. Run the tests using JUnit or TestNG.
